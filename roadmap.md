# ðŸš§ ROADMAP ðŸš§

Important Game Info:
- There will be 4 prestige layers (Overflow, Energize, ???, ???) (layers 3 and 4 will not be revealed yet)
- The game will not have numbers larger than ee15
- For layers Energize and beyond, mechanics will be contained within subtabs

Update B3: Replicanti

- Replicanti replicate 1.1x per second by default, and replicanti multiplies black hole mass gain and effect
- Replicanti Upgrade 1 increases the replication multiplier (1.1x by default)
- Replicanti Upgrade 2 decreases the replication interval (1 second by default)
- Replicanti Upgrade 3 increases max replicanti galaxies (0 by default, replicanti galaxies are weaker incrementy galaxies)

Update B4: Incrementy Challenges

- Each Incrementy Challenge has an unlock requirement, and each IC has their own nerfs, goal, and reward
- Each IC can be completed up to 3 times (except for IC8), and there are 8 Incrementy Challenges
- IC1: Incrementy is ^0.4, however manifolds are 5% cheaper. (Reward: Incrementy ^1.05 and manifolds are 5% cheaper)
- IC2: You can't buy Buyables 2 and 3, however Buyable 4 gives 10x free buyables, the IC1 multiplier is useless. (Reward: Buyable Factories give 3x more free levels)
- IC3: Buyables scale faster. (Reward: Buyables scale less)
- IC4: Research upgrades are disabled, however you can activate 3 of your choice, this choice is locked for the rest of the run. (Reward: Unlock 1 new research upgrade per completion)
- IC5: Every time you buy a buyable, all the other buyable scalings get more harsh. (Reward: Gain more incrementy and singularities based on Incrementy Challenge completions)
- IC6: There's an exponent linearly going from 0 to 1 over 10 seconds. If you buy anything, this exponent resets to 0. (Reward: Gain more incrementy based on time in this Overflow)
- IC7: All other challenges are combined (except for IC5). (Reward: IC1, IC2, IC3, IC5, and IC6 rewards are amplified for each completion)
- IC8: There's decrementy that rises that divides your incrementy production. (Reward: Unlock the new prestige layer)

Update C1: 2nd prestige layer (Called Energize, based off of Dilmod energize and DI Universal Collapse)
